## How to run the app

Do `npm install` and `npm start` for dev. Production version by `npm run deploy`

### Dependencies & Configuration:

The app is built with node/express & uses passport for authentication. React with Redux for the front end, packaged up by webpack, served by node/express.

Postgres or MySQL is needed to use it. The SQL setup file for both is in /db
The code uses SQL for all data manipulation but if you wish to extend it, you can also use an ORM. Models for Sequelize are provided indb/models

If you have docker set up it all becomes rather easy. Do `docker-compose up`. This will build the web (based on node) & postgres containers and lauch the app. 

If you modify the files, do 
`docker-compose down` & 
`docker-compose build web`

The docker config files are in the root of the project and can be modified to suit needs

Config files in server/config/config.js need to be added for the Google client credentials and also in the db/models/config.js for the Postgres db name and user credentials.
